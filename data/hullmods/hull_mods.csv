Neural Interface,neural_interface,3,,,"special, no_build_in",Special,10000,,,,0,0,0,0,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.hullmods.NeuralInterface,"Links the flagship with another ship, allowing switching between ships without using a shuttle pod. Both ships must have a Neural Interface and not be commanded by an officer or an AI core. The transfer is instant.

If the linked ship is destroyed or leaves the battlefield, the flagship will establish a neural link with another ship with a Neural Interface. If the flagship is destroyed or leaves the battlefield, command will have to be physically transferred to another ship with a Neural Interface before a new link can be established.

Both linked ships benefit from your personal combat skills as if you'd transferred command to them, regardless of which one you're controlling personally. As with ""transfer command"", some skill effects - such as those increasing ammo capacity, or other fixed ship stats - do not apply.",Allows rapid switching between ships.,graphics/hullmods/neural_interface.png
